# JOJO
Just an Ordinary Journey Opportunity  
Java-based RPG-style game that is nowhere near completion and is largely for experimentation and personal use. Currently consists of movement on Tiled maps (which is in the middle of being rewritten). Uses Pokemon Emerald assets temporarily for ease of use and lack of original art (and art skill). Please don't sue me Nintendo.

Needs [Slick](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) and [LWGJL 2](http://legacy.lwjgl.org/) (included with Slick download).  
LWGJL natives must be setup.  
Uses [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to create and generate world maps.
